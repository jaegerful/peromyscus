# Peromyscus

this program was made for the [Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/pharmacy/centers/peromyscus_genetic_stock_center/) at the University of South Carolina (UofSC).  
  
the application accomplishes two main goals:
1. **generate batches** of non-sibling mating pairs.
2. **insert used pairs from previous batches** into the center's database.
